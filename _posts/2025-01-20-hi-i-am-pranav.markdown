###### If you're reading this because the title enraged you, then you're just a person who got through the downs of Indian education by sheer luck. 

Why do people do an undergrad in India? I get it, a lot of people come from backgrounds where earning money is the sole focus. They honestly don't care about `education` which for me is `gaining new knowledge`. For them, spending 4-years in an institution is the only way a student can bring money and prosperity into their middle-class family lives.

Some of the maids that help my family in day-to-day chores used to ask me if I would be able to "pass the exam" during my school days. I never understood the gravity of this phrase because passing an exam, huh(**._.**)? What, isn't that like 50/100? But I would just respond with a plain "yes".

The reason I am talking about this is because its inbred in the common Indian mind that its okay if you're achieving the bare minimum. That's recurrent when an undergrad gets a normal job. Fortunately, both my parents have accomplished the top degrees in their fields so they made me realize that true achievements only come from the ability to contribute to the betterment of society which you can only learn in a school that realizes THIS is true education. That is what LACKS in Indian education.

But Pranav!? Both your parents studied in India. I am privileged that my parents come from families where they were taught that education is not just about passing an exam, or getting a job, but practicing to be the best, being passionate and obsessed in what you want to learn. They embraced that, embedded that into me, which is why **my ultimate goal is to receive the Turing Award for contributions to AI that revolutionizes society and helps humans, animals, and mother earth**. Yes, thats called a big dream and not *`I want to get into IIT and do a job`*. And anyhow, my parents completed their educations during a period when even getting a PhD degree was a great feat (it still is but its not enough now).

I know I haven't accomplished anything yet, I don't deserve to talk about this. If that's what you think, then: your ego > your work. I am in my final year of college, and learned nothing but one thing which is: stay away from backward minded people or simply ignore them. 

<h2>A short guide to a successful B.Tech in India</h2>

I don't really want to classify my college life as successful until I finally know where I am going for my Master's in the US. But I know I lived a complete, all-rounded 4 years in the outskirts of Chennai (a town I am not really fond of anymore). Here's what I would classify as all-rounded:

* High GPA
* Multiple Internships
* Research Projects
* Leadership activities and student collaborations
* Fun with friends (travelling, birthday, eating, etc.)
* A clear path for your next endeavours

###### If you're reading this because the title enraged you, then you're just a person who got through the downs of Indian education by sheer luck. 

Why do people do an undergrad in India? I get it, a lot of people come from backgrounds where earning money is the sole focus. They honestly don't care about `education` which for me is `gaining new knowledge`. For them, spending 4-years in an institution is the only way a student can bring money and prosperity into their middle-class family lives.

Some of the maids that help my family in day-to-day chores used to ask me if I would be able to "pass the exam" during my school days. I never understood the gravity of this phrase because passing an exam, huh(**._.**)? What, isn't that like 50/100? But I would just respond with a plain "yes".

The reason I am talking about this is because its inbred in the common Indian mind that its okay if you're achieving the bare minimum. That's recurrent when an undergrad gets a normal job. Fortunately, both my parents have accomplished the top degrees in their fields so they made me realize that true achievements only come from the ability to contribute to the betterment of society which you can only learn in a school that realizes that THIS is true education. That is what I believe LACKS in Indian education.

But Pranav!? Both your parents studied in India. I am privileged that my parents come from families where they were taught that education is not just about passing an exam, or getting a job, but practicing to be the best, being passionate and obsessed in what you want to learn. They embraced that, embedded that into me, which is why **my ultimate goal is to receive the Turing Award for contributions to AI that revolutionizes society and helps humans, animals, and mother earth**. Yes, thats called a big dream and not *`I want to get into IIT and do a job`*. And anyhow, my parents completed their educations during a period when even getting a PhD degree was a great feat (it still is but its not enough now).

I know I haven't accomplished anything yet, I don't deserve to talk about this. If that's what you think, then: your ego > your work. I am in my final year of college, and learned nothing but one thing which is: stay away from backward minded people or simply ignore them. 

<h2>A short guide to a successful B.Tech in India</h2>

I don't really want to classify my college life as successful until I finally know where I am going for my Master's in the US. But I know I lived a complete, all-rounded 4 years in the outskirts of Chennai (a town I am not really fond of anymore). Here's what I would classify as all-rounded:

* High GPA
* Multiple Internships
* Research Projects
* Leadership activities and student collaborations
* Fun with friends (travelling, birthday, eating, etc.)
* A clear path for your next endeavours

All in all, if you have a solid resume and you've made some incredible memories with friends not lost, then I'd say you had a successful undergraduate.

<h3>General College Life.</h3>

**High GPA.** If a person tells you to "chill" in your first year of college then `stay away` from them. I made sure during my first year of college that I will explore new areas of AI but unlike my school days, I had the thirst to be consistent with my grades. In my first year I made the habit of doing *neat* hard work. Whatever I presented, memorized, learned and understood, I did it with absolute integrity. People brought in chits and phones during the exams like done in most indian colleges but I made sure my preparation would beat whatever new way of cheating they would invent.

I made sure I studied for several days before to ace my internal exams (CTs, assignments, vivas, etc). The motivation I had after coming to SRM was built-up energy from feeling like a failure after finishing school.

I would suggest to practice EVERY question in math since most questions in exams come from PYQs themselves. I made sure I understood how to solve each problem. I made friends, just like me - motivated to do well and seeing them study when I felt free was a big push. I never really paid attention to courses like EVS or Social Engineering because I was mostly focused on my PCM and Computer Science courses but still made sure I studied enough so that my grades don't lack in these silly courses. 

But your GPA should NEVER be below a 9. NEVER. The competition today is like getting crushed in a stampede. A lot of people will have 10 CGPA until the end of their second year. Be it jobs or higher studies, if your GPA is high, you will be preferred in whatever situation your resume is in. Some grad school programs and companies are very GPA-centric. A low GPA will always be your losing factor.

You should never fail to fight with your professors for your grades if they're less or even if they're high. Its just many "please"s and "I will really work hard in the next exam"s that can probably increase your marks if they get fed up listening to you. Try to be alone when doing this when there aren't many students beside you. If your professor is benevolent he might even increase your marks if you verbally explain to him an answer that you got wrong in the exam. 

Honestly, in the end its a bit of luck. Your final exams are going to be checked by a random "professor" who exists to cut your marks on purpose.Just pray to God. If your examiner is benevolent, you'll get the grades you deserve. If not, it sucks (I have been there), you move on and focus on your main purpose of life.

**Classes.** I think I'll start by addressing the cumbersome `75% attendance`. Because of this rule, I have wasted an incredible amount of time going to campus and learning nothing. I'd rather sit in class and work on my own projects than listen or even look towards the blackboard. I am the most productive at home, on my chair with a coffee next to me.

`Classes are so very boring`. There really aren't many interesting professors, at least in my college. Coming from someone who really wanted to be the best in computer science, my professors failed me with their ego, lack of interest and shortcuts in teaching. Classes become monotonous especially when you're doing subjects you really don't want to learn about (EVS/Social Engineering). You just need to pick up as much as you can from the topics being taught, and push through with droopy, dark circles in your eyes. Your best way of studying is either reading the tedious power point presentation with over 200 slides, or going through multiple youtube videos to learn about that topic. They even provide you with these amazing books that you never open :).

I made sure I was in the good books of each teacher. I would sometimes just call them up and tell them that I'm not well and convince them to mark me present for the class. Some even agreed to letting me work on my laptop if I sat at the end of the room.

But to lighten the mood of this blog, I was never a very studious person in class with a pen and notebook in my hand and writing down notes all the time. My friends and I were trouble makers; we sat at the back of the class doing pranks on each other, talking about our favourite band and yes, annoying the professor. And that part is the only thing that makes me miss going to classes: hanging out with friends.

I started off buying notebooks for each class I had in my first year, and by the end of my third year, a single small diary did the job. 

**College Activities.** My college had numerous clubs - from Google and Microsoft's Student Clubs, to one of my college's biggest highlights, Next Tech Lab. I joined another club called Coding Ninjas, but that died in less than a year. Next Tech Lab was known to be the hardest club to join in my college, and I got to know about this from a senior of mine who was the Head AI researcher there. I gave a simple interview discussing my knowledge and passion in AI and got in. I met a lot of people just like me - striving to be the best, to get some insane internships - but only a handful trying to attend grad school after undergraduation.  We all had that self-motivation to code and develop softwares and do AI research and advance the state-of-the-art. But since there were no professors that actually did cutting-edge research, we ourselves were lost just trying to find internships. 

**A small detour from college activities.**
There was no push for independent research: peers start following each other down a narrow path of finishing college with a high GPA, getting some internships and subsequently securing a job with a 10 LPA+ package. 

The college itself will put more efforts into getting students mediocre jobs, while I got no recognition for the papers I published or the research internships I secured. The mentality is such that getting a `high paying job > doing higher studies`. I can't stress this enough when I say how `pushed away` you feel from the college when your goal is to get into a good grad school. You feel like an alien or an outlaw, because NO ONE cares. Some people after reading this might feel so strongly against, but my entire 4 years I have SLOGGED to secure research internships, and I did everything with negative help from the college.

Here's some examples of negative help. I got an internship at IISc, the top institution for research in India, and I had to travel every month from Bangalore to Chennai because conducting futile 15-minute reviews physically for my Bachelor's minor project was more important. Now here's the discrimination against students pursuing higher studies: the students who got industry internships didn't even require to do the minor project course or attend any reviews, they only need to submit an end-of-the-semester report on what they did in their internship. I, arguably working harder and better than most students, was not only forced to take the minor project course, but I also had to travel at the end of every month to attend reviews with zero outcomes. ALSO, they considered my research internship at IISc and Stanford not a part of the course, while getting a job in a mediocre company was something they CHERISHED, CELEBRATED, ANNOUNCED and CONGRATULATED. I hope you can hear my anger in this paragraph. It was nonsensical, and a waste money and time. Ironically, I am writing this paragraph right now, sitting in a plane on my way to Chennai to attend my major project review. 

**Back to college activities.** 
With over 20,000 students in each batch, students had a diverse range of skills in my college. I loved going to flash mobs, fashion shows, and singing nights in my college. Festivals were celebrated with a lot of joy, from traditional hindu festivals like Diwali and Holi to Christmas and Eid. I even attended celebrations related to Pongal and Onam where I learned a lot about south indian culture and food (nothing beats Delhi food). We also had big tech festivals like Milan and Aarush, and the college would really light up. I have made some incredible memories with my friends during these days. I'd `recommend` to take time off from your busy schedules and really attend such celebrations because you JUST have 4 years and they pass by in a blur.

`April 22nd, 2025`

Updating after 3 months. I got into the MS CSE program at the University of Michigan and I am super excited to start my research journey at one of the top CS institutions in the world.

**Life in general**
It is honestly a big culture shift when a north Indian student studies in South India. The people and values are different. I don't want to talk much on this but I definitely sensed a lot of resentment towards "my kind" from the locals there. The autos have a weird monopoly and its difficult to negotiate prices if you don't know their language. But I guess it could be the opposite as well (a south indian coming to north india). Restaurants, theatres, etc shut down early. There are a lot of food streets in Chennai however which I liked going to for a nice snack.

I was constantly in search of new research projects since the start because I just didn't want to waste time. I emailed professors and collaborated on as many projects as I can. Now here's what I faced: the professors in my college really didn't care about the research (sad truth). I wasted a year trying to find a good research project that could lead to a paper in my college. 

- talk about exam reevaluation
- problems I faced in my city
- problems with hostels, mess food.
- odyssey lab
